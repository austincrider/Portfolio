# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!

I will be using this space to show off things I have written for work and play. Hopefully, I can display a marked improvement as my coding and automation journey progresses.

## About Me

My name is Austin. I love to learn, and I am always trying to improve my skills.

I have worked in the technology field for over thirteen years. I have had the pleasure of working in a variety of IT roles (everything from network administration to identity and automation engineering), and I have met some great people along the way.

## Goals

### Languages

* Python
* PowerShell
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript

### Details
Below, I will keep a running list of my goals, and cross them off as they appear in my portfolio!

* Over the next year, I want to dig deeper into Python and PowerShell for scripting and automation purposes.
    * ~~In Python, I want to perform ETL tasks utilizing Pandas.~~
    * For PowerShell, I want to convert my old M365 administration scripts into MS Graph modules.
    * I want to explore MS Graph scopes and empower my team to perform administration tasks without the need for Global Admin access.
* I will be taking training courses for full stack development.
    * I want to dig deeper into JavaScript and learn a specific framework.
    * ~~I will start this journey by studying Git and how to best utilize it for versioning.~~
* My ultimate goal is to create something that helps other people!
